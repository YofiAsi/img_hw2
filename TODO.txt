What is left to do:

1. test what we have right now with cubes. we need to make sure that the intersect function of cubes works.

2. test on more scenes

3. Transparency:
for it to work we need to rewrite refract to get the new ray that comes out if the object.
Right now this is not what we have.

4. BEFORE SENDING THE PROJECT WE NEED TO REMOVE TQDM FROM THE CODE
